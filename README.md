## Coin Toss

Click the "Flip" button to simulate flipping a coin. Possible outcomes are heads or tails with 50% probability for each.

## Sudoku

To play, 

1. Click a number (1-9) in the 3x3 grid on the right-hand side of the screen to select the number you want to use next.
2. Click the cell in the 9x9 grid on the left-hand side of the screen to fill it in using the number you selected from Step 1.

You will be prevented from filling in any numbers that violate the rules (i.e. no repeated numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid). A message will appear under the sudoku grid informing you any time you attempt to make a move that violates the rules.

To start a new game, click the "Restart Game" button at the bottom of the page.

3. Right click to flag and unflag tiles as mines. 
4. Game over when all mines are flagged correctly, or a mine is opened.

## Tetris

The game starts the moment you open the webpage. Use the left and right arrow buttons on your keyboard to move the blocks as they fall, and the down arrow to accelerate the speed at which they fall. Press the space button to change the orientation of the blocks before it reaches the bottom surface; each press rotates the tetromino block 90 degrees clockwise.
